The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers
interested in applying computational techniques to problems in
morphology, phonology, and phonetics. Work that addresses orthographic
issues is also welcome. Papers will be on substantial, original, and
unpublished research on these topics, potentially including strong
work in progress. Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to)
the following as they relate to the areas of the workshop:

<ul>
<li>New formalisms, computational treatments, or probabilistic models of existing linguistic formalisms 
<li>Unsupervised, semi-supervised or machine learning of linguistic knowledge 
<li>Models of psycholinguistic experiments 
<li>Morpheme identification and word segmentation 
<li>Algorithms, including finite-state methods 
<li>Corpus linguistics 
<li>Machine transliteration and back-transliteration 
<li>Speech technologies relating to phonetics or phonology 
<li>Speech science (both production and comprehension) 
<li>Analysis or exploitation of multilingual, multi-dialectal, or diachronic data 
<li>Instructional technologies for second-language learners 
<li>Integration of morphology, phonology, or phonetics with other NLP tasks 
<li>Tools and resources 
<li>Approaches to orthographic variation
</ul>

<p>
One of the missions of SIGMORPHON is to encourage interaction between
work in computational linguistics and work in theoretical phonetics,
phonology and morphology, and to ensure that each of these fields
profits from the interaction. Our recent meetings have been successful
in this regard, and we hope to see this continue in 2014. Many
mainstream linguists studying phonetics, phonology and morphology are
employing computational tools and models that are of considerable
interest to computational linguists. Similarly, models and tools
developed by and for computational linguists may be of interest to
theoretical linguists working in these areas. This workshop provides a
forum for these researchers to interact and become exposed to each
others' ideas and research.

papers should not exceed four (4) pages. One additional page is
allowed for the References section in both cases.  However, all
material other than the bibliography must fall within the first 8/4
pages! We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or
Microsoft Word document template that will available on the ACL
conference web site. We reserve the right to reject submissions that

<h2>Shared Task: Morphological Reinflection</h2>

<p>Main site: <a href="http://ryancotterell.github.io/sigmorphon2016/">http://ryancotterell.github.io/sigmorphon2016/</a></p>

<p>
Morphological analysis and generation of previously unseen word forms
is a fundamental problem in NLP the accuracy of which is crucial for
the success of many downstream tasks.  Learning morphological
inflection patterns from labeled data is a current challenge that is
addressed by a number of papers published in various ACL-related
venues. To bring together researchers working on inference problems
related to morphology, SIGMORPHON is hosting a shared task on
morphological reinflection in 2016, held at ACL in Berlin, Germany.
</p>

<p>
In the shared task, participants will build systems that can learn to
solve different reinflection problems using labeled data. An example
of English reinflection is the conversion of "ran" to its present
participle, "running". Specifically, a participant system needs to be
able to (1) produce inflected word forms from a lemma, and (2)
generate a specific inflected word form from some other labeled
inflected form, and (3) generate inflected word forms from unlabeled
word forms of the same lemma. All submitted systems will be compared
on a held-out test set.
</p>

<p>
Participants will also be invited to describe their system in a short
paper for the SIGMORPHON 2016 workshop. The task organizers will write
an overview paper with descriptions and summaries of the different
approaches taken and their results.
</p>

<p>
Questions about the shared task can be sent to
<a href="mailto:sigmorphon-shared-task-2016-organizers@googlegroups.com">sigmorphon-shared-task-2016-organizers@googlegroups.com</a>. More
information about the task, including training and development data
sets for the target languages of varying morphological complexity is
available at the shared task home page.
