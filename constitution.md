## Statement of Purpose

The purpose of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Special Interest Group on Computational Morphology and Phonology (the SIG) is to foster computational research on the phonological, morphological, and phonetic properties of human language. Specifically, the SIG aims to promote interest in these subjects; to foster discussion of these subjects among members of the ACL; and to sponsor relevant meetings and workshops that appear to be timely and worthwile, operating within the framework of the ACL's general guidelines for SIGs.

## Elected Officers

The elected officers of the SIG shall consist of a President, a Secretary and up to four others, together forming the Executive Committee. The President and Secretary shall be members in good standing of the ACL. The term of all elected officers of the SIG shall be two years. The President shall remain a member of the Executive Committee for the subsequent term to provide continuity.

The duties of the President shall be:
1. To have primary executive authority over actions and activities of the SIG.
1. To be primarily responsible for communication with the Executive Committee of the ACL, and to prepare a written report on the activities of the SIG for the Executive Committee of the ACL, for presentation to the ACL at its Annual Business Meeting.
1. To designate a Liaison Representative, who shall be be primarily responsible for communication with members of the SIG and answering inquiries about the SIG.
1. To designate a Resources Manager for the SIG, who shall be responsible for maintaining public resources provided by the SIG, such as websites and mailing lists.

The duties of the Secretary shall be:

1. To maintain a membership roster of the SIG.
1. To be responsible for any moneys awarded to the SIG by the ACL; to collect and manage any dues that may be required by the SIG; and to prepare any reports on the SIG finances that may be requested by the Executive Committee of the ACL.

## Membership

Membership is open to anyone who professes an interest in computational phonology. Membership will be terminated on request, or automatically if no reply is received within 2 months of an annual membership renewal request. Such requests are to be communicated by the medium, and to the address, last notified to the Secretary. Automatically terminated memberships will be reinstated on request.

## Election of Officers

All officers of the SIG shall be elected by a vote of the membership. Voting shall commence at least two months before the expiration of the current terms of the officers, and voting shall close on that expiration date. Four weeks prior to the commencement of voting, SIG members will be given notice to submit nominations for SIG officers. Each nomination must be seconded by two SIG members and must provide evidence that the nominee will serve if elected.

Where there is only one nominee for a given position, the nominee will be declared elected. If there is more than one nominee for any position a vote shall take place. Votes may be entered by electronic or physical mail or other designated means, and votes arriving by the notified closing date will be counted by the Secretary or another officer appointed by the Executive Committee. Any nominee receiving a majority of the votes will be declared elected. The new positions will become active immediately after the announcement of the results, and the previous officers will remain active for three months to ease the transition.

If a vacancy occurs among the officers of the SIG, the remaining SIG officers may nominate a replacement officer who will serve out the remainder of the previous office holder's term.

## Referenda

A change to this constitution, or a motion on any other matter, may be initiated by five members (petitioners) in writing or by agreement of the President and Secretary (on the suggestion of a member or otherwise). The motions will be put to the members within six months of receipt of a petition, if the petitioners so request. Otherwise, constitutional amendments and other motions will be put to the vote in conjunction with the regular elections.

Members will be notified at least two months before voting commences that a referendum is to take place, and further motions (including constitutional amendments) proposed by two members shall be accepted up to one month before the start of voting. Motions may be modified or withdrawn by their proposers at any time before the start of voting. All members of the SIG shall be notified promptly of all motions and modifications thereto, to permit discussion.

Votes may be entered by electronic or physical mail or other designated means, and votes arriving by the notified closing date will be counted by a returning officer appointed by the Executive Committee and agreed to by the petitioners. The voting period shall be at least one month, and results shall be communicated promptly to the members.

Any change to this constitution requires a two-thirds majority of those votes received from eligible voters and is subject to approval by ACL. Any other matter requires a simple majority.

Notification shall signify dispatch of mail by the medium, and to the address, last notified to the secretary.

## Dues

Subject to the approval of the Executive Committee of the ACL the SIG may levy annual membership dues, where the rate is determined by the Executive Committee. In certain circumstances, the Executive Committee may decide to waive the fee.
