Welcome to the home page of the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Morphology and Phonology (SIGMORPHON), formerly known as the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Phonology (SIGPHON). This group provides a forum for exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in computational morphology and phonology.

**Workshops:** SIGMORPHON also organizes workshops in computational morphology and phonology. The last biennial meeting was the [14th SIGMORPHON Workshop](http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/sigmorphon/), which took place at ACL 2016 in Berlin, Germany, on August 11, 2016.

**Shared tasks:** SIGMORPHON co-organized the [CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task](https://sites.google.com/view/conll-sigmorphon2017/home) on learning morphological inflection. We also organized a [previous shared task](http://ryancotterell.github.io/sigmorphon2016/) on inflection, which coincided with the 14th SIGMORPHON Workshop at ACL 2016. Thanks to all those who participated!
