## Overview

In 2018, [SIGMORPHON](https://sigmorphon.github.io/) and [CoNLL](http://www.conll.org/) are hosting a 
shared task on __universal morphological reinflection__. An example 
of English reinflection is the conversion of `ran` to its present 
participle, `running`.

To participate in the shared task, you will build a system that can
learn to solve reinflection problems.  All submitted systems will be 
compared on a held-out test set.

You will be invited to describe your system in a system paper for
the CoNLL 2018 shared task proceedings.  The task organizers will write an
overview paper that describes the task and summarizes the different
approaches taken and their results.
