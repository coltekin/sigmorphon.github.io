The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers
interested in applying computational techniques to problems in
morphology, phonology, and phonetics. Work that addresses orthographic
issues is also welcome. Papers will be on substantial, original, and
unpublished research on these topics, potentially including strong
work in progress. Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to)
the following as they relate to the areas of the workshop:

<ul>
<li>New formalisms, computational treatments, or probabilistic models of existing linguistic formalisms 
<li>Unsupervised, semi-supervised or machine learning of linguistic knowledge 
<li>Models of psycholinguistic experiments 
<li>Morpheme identification and word segmentation 
<li>Algorithms, including finite-state methods 
<li>Corpus linguistics 
<li>Machine transliteration and back-transliteration 
<li>Speech technologies relating to phonetics or phonology 
<li>Speech science (both production and comprehension) 
<li>Analysis or exploitation of multilingual, multi-dialectal, or diachronic data 
<li>Instructional technologies for second-language learners 
<li>Integration of morphology, phonology, or phonetics with other NLP tasks 
<li>Tools and resources 
<li>Approaches to orthographic variation
</ul>

<p>
One of the missions of SIGMORPHON is to encourage interaction between
work in computational linguistics and work in theoretical phonetics,
phonology and morphology, and to ensure that each of these fields
profits from the interaction. Our recent meetings have been successful
in this regard, and we hope to see this continue in 2014. Many
mainstream linguists studying phonetics, phonology and morphology are
employing computational tools and models that are of considerable
interest to computational linguists. Similarly, models and tools
developed by and for computational linguists may be of interest to
theoretical linguists working in these areas. This workshop provides a
forum for these researchers to interact and become exposed to each
others' ideas and research.

<h3>Important Dates</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>? May 2017</b> Paper submission deadline
<li><b>? June 2017:</b> Notification of acceptance
<li><b>? June 2017:</b> Camera-ready papers due
<li><b>??? 2017:</b> Workshop
</ul>

<h3>Schedule</h3>


<h3>Paper Submission</h3>

<p>
<b>Content:</b> Long papers should be original, topical, and
clear. Completed work is preferable to intended work, but in any event
the paper should clearly indicate the state of completion of the
reported results. We also encourage short submissions, which can cover
research, or can describe important problems (new or old).
</p>

<p>
<b>Submission Format:</b> The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions should be anonymous, without authors
or an acknowledgement section; self-citations should appear in third
person. Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL
proceedings, and long papers should not exceed eight (8) pages, short
papers should not exceed four (4) pages. One additional page is
allowed for the References section in both cases.  However, all
material other than the bibliography must fall within the first 8/4
pages! We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or
Microsoft Word document template that will available on the ACL
conference web site. We reserve the right to reject submissions that
do not conform to these styles, including font size restrictions.

<h2>Shared Task: Universal Morphological Reinflection</h2>

<p>More news later!</p>

<p>
Morphological analysis and generation of previously unseen word forms
is a fundamental problem in NLP the accuracy of which is crucial for
the success of many downstream tasks.  Learning morphological
inflection patterns from labeled data is a current challenge that is
addressed by a number of papers published in various ACL-related
venues. To bring together researchers working on inference problems
related to morphology, SIGMORPHON is planning a shared task in concjuntion
with the workshop.
</p>

<p>
In the shared task, participants will build systems that can learn to
solve different reinflection problems using labeled data. An example
of English reinflection is the conversion of "ran" to its present
participle, "running". Specifically, a participant system needs to be
able to (1) produce inflected word forms from a lemma, and (2)
generate a specific inflected word form from some other labeled
inflected form, and (3) generate inflected word forms from unlabeled
word forms of the same lemma. All submitted systems will be compared
on a held-out test set.
</p>

<p>
Participants will also be invited to describe their system in a short
paper for the SIGMORPHON 2017 workshop. The task organizers will write
an overview paper with descriptions and summaries of the different
approaches taken and their results.
