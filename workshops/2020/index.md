SIGMORPHON aims to bring together researchers interested in applying computational techniques
to problems in morphology, phonology, and phonetics. Work that addresses orthographic issues is also welcome.
Papers will be on substantial, original, and unpublished research on these topics,
potentially including strong work in progress. Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to) the
following as they relate to the areas of the workshop:

- New formalisms, computational treatments, or probabilistic models of existing linguistic formalisms
- Unsupervised, semi-supervised, or machine learning of linguistic knowledge
- Analysis or exploitation of multilingual, multi-dialectal, or diachronic data
- Integration of morphology, phonology, or phonetics with other NLP tasks
- Algorithms for string analysis and manipulation, including finite-state methods
- Models of psycholinguistic experiments
- Approaches to orthographic variation
- Approaches to morphological reinflection
- Corpus linguistics
- Machine transliteration and back-transliteration
- Morpheme identification and word segmentation
- Speech technologies relating to phonetics or phonology
- Speech science (both production and comprehension)
- Instructional technologies for second-language learners
- Tools and resources

SIGMORPHON encourages interaction between work in computational linguistics
and work in theoretical phonetics, phonology and morphology, and to ensure that
each of these fields profits from the interaction. Our recent meetings have been
successful in this regard, and we hope to see this continue in 2020.

Many mainstream linguists studying phonetics, phonology and morphology
are employing computational tools and models that are of
considerable interest to computational linguists. Similarly, models and tools developed by
and for computational linguists may be of interest to theoretical linguists working in these areas.
This workshop provides a forum for these researchers to interact
and become exposed to each others’ ideas and research.

## Important Dates

April 7, 2020 (anywhere in the world): Paper submission deadline <br>May 4, 2020: Notification of acceptance <br>
May 22, 2020: Camera-ready papers due <br>
<strong> July 10, 2020: Workshop </strong> <br>

## Paper submission

<https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/SIGMORPHON/>

### Content

Long papers should be original, topical, and clear. Completed work is preferable to intended work.
Either way, the paper must disclose the state of completion of the reported results.
We also encourage short submissions. These can either cover research or describe
important problems (new or old).

### Submission format

The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions should be anonymous,
without authors or an acknowledgement section; self-citations should appear in third person.
Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings,
and long papers should not exceed eight (8) pages, short papers should not exceed four (4) pages.
Unlimited additional pages are allowed for the references section in both cases.
However, all material other than the bibliography must fall within the first 8/4 pages!
<strong> The camera-ready submission will be allowed to have 1 extra page to address reviewer concerns. </strong>
We encourage the submission of supplemental material such as data and code,
as well as appendices; however, supplemental material should not be essential
for the understanding of the submission.
We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document
template on the ACL conference website. We reserve the right to reject submissions
that do not conform to these styles, including font size restrictions.

### Anonymity period

SIGMORPHON 2020 adopts ACL’s new policies for submission, review, and citation.
Submissions that violate any of these policies will be rejected without review.
Most importantly, the policies refer to the anonymity period, which begins
one month before the 2020 submission deadline and ends at time of
notification (or withdrawal).

### Mentorship Program

This year SIGMORPHON plans to offer a mentorship program in conjunction with its 2020 workshop. The goal of the program is to connect researchers new to the field of computational morphology and phonology with more experienced members of our sub-community. Any researcher may request mentorship by filling out [this Google form](https://forms.gle/ikQEKfsR2vwCrR7r9). Those who sign up will be matched with more senior researchers who will act as a mentor and both of you will be placed in contact. As ACL 2020 will be virtual, we expect all mentorship to take place remotely this year.

#### How will SIGMORPHON’s mentorship work? 
We will organize remote 1-on-1 mentoring sessions. Through our mentorship program, 
SIGMORPHON hopes to specifically reach the following groups:
Not-yet-graduate students considering applying to doctoral programs,
Graduate students who will soon enter the academic or industrial job market,
Students seeking feedback on high-level research ideas.
However, in principle, anyone can sign up!

#### What is SIGMORPHON mentorship? 
The exact nature will depend on the particular mentor--mentee pairing. However, the default assumption, unless otherwise negotiated, is that there should be a 1-hour meeting between the mentor and mentee. SIGMORPHON encourages further cultivation of the mentorship if fitting. 

Matched mentors and mentees will be placed in contact and are expected to set up one or more virtual meetings during the week of ACL (July 5, 2020 – Fri, July 10, 2020).
