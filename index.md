Welcome to the home page of the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Morphology and Phonology (SIGMORPHON). We are a forum for exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in computational morphology and phonology.

**Workshops:** SIGMORPHON also organizes [workshops]({{ "/workshops" | absolute_url }}) in computational morphology and phonology. The next biennial meeting will be the [17th SIGMORPHON Workshop]({{ "/workshops/2020" | absolute_url }}), which will take place at ACL 2020 in Seattle, USA in July.

**Shared tasks:** SIGMORPHON is organizing the [SIGMORPHON 2020 shared task](sharedtasks/2020) on phonology and morphology. It will be presented during ACL 2020. We also organized [four previous shared tasks]({{ "/sharedtasks" | absolute_url }}). Thanks to all those who participated!
