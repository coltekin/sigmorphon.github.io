## Overview
A word's form reflects syntactic and semantic features that are expressed by the word. For example, each English count noun has both singular and plural forms (robot/robots, process/processes), known as the **inflected forms** of the noun. A Polish verb can have [nearly 100 inflected forms](http://www.tastingpoland.com/language/verb/dodac_add_verb.html).

NLP systems must be able to analyze and generate all of these inflected forms. Fortunately, inflected forms tend to be systematically related to one another. This is why English speakers can usually predict the singular form from the plural and vice-versa, even for words they have never seen before.

We are hosting a shared task on **universal morphological reinflection**. That is, the shared task of morphological reinflection will be conducted in **40+ languages of the world**. An example of English reinflection is the conversion of `ran` to its present participle, `running`. To participate in the shared task, you will build a system that can learn to solve reinflection problems. All submitted systems will be compared on a held-out test set.
