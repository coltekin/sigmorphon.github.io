Welcome to the home page of the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Morphology and Phonology (SIGMORPHON). We are a forum for exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in computational morphology and phonology.

**Workshops:** SIGMORPHON also organizes [workshops]({{ "/workshops" | absolute_url }}) in computational morphology and phonology. Our most recent meeting (outside our biennial cycle) was the [16th SIGMORPHON Workshop]({{ "/workshops/2019" | absolute_url }}), which took place at ACL 2019 in Florence, Italy on 2 August.

**Shared tasks:** SIGMORPHON organized the [SIGMORPHON 2019 shared task](sharedtasks/2019) on learning morphological inflection. It was presented during ACL 2019. We also organized [three previous shared tasks]({{ "/sharedtasks" | absolute_url }}). Thanks to all those who participated!
