Welcome to the home page of the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Morphology and Phonology (SIGMORPHON), formerly SIGPHON. We are a forum for exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in computational morphology and phonology.

**Workshops:** SIGMORPHON also organizes [workshops]({{ "/workshops" | absolute_url }}) in computational morphology and phonology. The next meeting (outside our biennial cycle) will be the [16th SIGMORPHON Workshop]({{ "/workshops/2019" | absolute_url }}), which will take place at ACL 2019 in Florence, Italy on 2 August.

**Shared tasks:** SIGMORPHON is organizing the [SIGMORPHON 2019 shared task](sharedtasks/2019) on learning morphological inflection. It will be presented during ACL 2019. We also organized [three previous shared tasks]({{ "/sharedtasks" | absolute_url }}). Thanks to all those who participated!
