We invite systems that wish to compete on any of the previous year’s shared tasks:

- [2018](../2018): CoNLL–SIGMORPHON Shared Task: Universal Morphological Reinflection
    - Task 1: Inflection
    - Task 2: Inflection in context
- [2017](../2017): CoNLL–SIGMORPHON Shared Task: Universal Morphological Reinflection
    - Task 1: Inflection
    - Task 2: Paradigm cell filling
- [2016](../2016): SIGMORPHON Shared Task: Morphological Reinflection
    - Task 1: Inflection
    - Task 2: Re-inflecting an inflected form, given its MSD
    - Task 3: Re-inflecting an inflected form, without its MSD

Have a great system for those datasets? We would like to invite you to submit a system description paper and tell us about it! We will publish it with the rest of the SIGMORPHON proceedings.

The critical requirement for any system is that it must be made **open-source**, as we want to foster a community for reproducible research. Submissions which do not meet this requirement will not be considered.
